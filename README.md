## Task 3


# Task 4
"Coloured Shadow" Changes the colour of the shadows casted on the object by itself and other objects.  
It takes in 3 properties, the colour and material of the object and then the colour that the shadows casted on the object should be.

It takes in the shadow attenuation and then multiplies the inverse of the attenuation by the shadow colour. Anything not in a shadow takes in the colour and material and the light colour and uses that to determing the colour of the object in light.
